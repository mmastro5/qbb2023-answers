Week 1 exercise questions:

2.2:
1) the size of the relationship is the coeficient value (0.3776) or the slope within this context, which looks similar to the slope of the graph. So, as maternal age increases the number of denovo mutations increases by 0.3776
2) since the p-value is coming up as 0.000, the relationship is significant.

2.3
1) the size of the relationship is the coeficient value (1.3538) or the slope within this context, which looks similar to the slope of the graph. So, as paternal age increases the number of denovo mutations increases by 1.3538
2) since the p-value is coming up as 0.000, the relationship is significant.

2.4
y = mx + b
y = 1.3538 (x) + 10.3263
y = 1.3538 (50.5) + 10.3263
y = 68.3669 + 10.3263
y = 78.6932


2.6
1) a t-test, because it compares the means between two groups to se if they are significantly different.
2) the t test result gave a pvalue of 2.1986e-264, so they are significantly different ages.
