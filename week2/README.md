Exercise 1:

1.1
100bp, 1Mbp genome, 3x coverage
(3* 1million)/100bp 
3 million / 100 = 30,000 reads

1.2
see graphs

1.3
1. When using a 3x coverage: there were 49,226 bps with 0 coverage (4.9226%)
2. The Poisson curve fits the graph with lower coverage more than the normal distribution.

1.4
1. When using a 10x coverage: there were 56 bps with 0 coverage (0.0056%)
2. As the coverage increases, the normal distribution starts to fit the graph more, though the poisson curve still fits this data.

1.5
1. When using a 30x coverage: there were 2 bps with 0 coverage (0.0002%)
2. As this is the highest coverage, the normal distribution seems to fit the simulation more as the poisson curve seems slightly off centered in this instance. 



Exercise 2:

To accurately reconstruct the sequence of genome, we can use larger coverages to get stronger overlap, and have more reads to have more copies to create these overlaps. Also, to see how many loops we may go through we can take those sections and see how large the area is through pcr and a gel to see how many times that section goes through a paticular loop. 

Exercise 3:
1. Prompt: Write a 3 paragraph essay with in text citations on why you are interested in genomics. 
ChatGPT resoponse:

I am deeply interested in genomics due to its remarkable potential to transform our understanding of biology and human health. Genomics is the study of an organism's complete genetic material, encompassing the entire set of genes and their interactions within an organism's DNA. It has led to groundbreaking discoveries, such as the Human Genome Project, which decoded the entire sequence of the human genome, comprising over 3 billion base pairs (Lander et al., 2001). This monumental achievement unveiled the intricate genetic instructions that underlie our existence, sparking my fascination with genomics.

Furthermore, genomics holds the promise of personalized medicine and healthcare (Collins et al., 2003). By analyzing an individual's genetic makeup, doctors can tailor medical treatments to match a patient's unique genetic profile. This approach not only enhances the effectiveness of therapies but also reduces adverse side effects. The potential to revolutionize healthcare through genomics is a testament to its significance and its capacity to improve human well-being.

Additionally, genomics has profound implications for fields beyond medicine, such as agriculture and environmental conservation. It plays a pivotal role in crop breeding, enabling the development of genetically modified organisms that can address global food security challenges (Tester & Langridge, 2010). Moreover, genomics contributes to conservation biology by helping scientists monitor and protect endangered species through DNA analysis (Moritz, 1994). These applications demonstrate the breadth of genomics' impact, making it a captivating field that offers solutions to some of the world's most pressing issues.

In conclusion, my interest in genomics stems from its power to uncover the genetic secrets of life, advance healthcare through personalized medicine, and address critical challenges in agriculture and conservation. Genomics represents a profound frontier of scientific discovery, holding the potential to reshape our world for the better. It is this potential for groundbreaking advancements and the ability to contribute to the betterment of society that fuels my passion for genomics.

2. Within the first paragraph, I would not have written "a set of genes interacting with DNA", as genes are transcribed from our DNA, and perhaps some genes interact with our DNA but that is not the main outcome from our genes. I would have mentioned the Human genome project as a groundbreaking project within the genomics. 
The second paragraph sounds wonderful, but seems to be escalated to sound better. Instead, I would have talked about sequencing or genotyping patient DNA, can help us personalize treatments in the future, but would have liked a more recent citation on current data in the field looking for that information. 
I believe food insecurity and using genomics to reshape good is a great point to bring up as well, but I would not have included endangered species conservation for why I personally care about genomics. 
Of the citations: Lander et al., 2001 exists as the Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome in Nature, so is the relevant citation. Collins et al 2003 exists but is on Lipolysis and free fatty acid catabolism in cheese: a review of current knowledge so not on expected knowledge. Tester & Langridge, 2010 as Breeding Technologies to Increase Crop Production in a Changing World, so relevant to their fppd insecurity claims. Moritz, 1994 Defining 'Evolutionarily Significant Units' for conservation, so relevant to their conservation claims but a little outdated to be using for current claims.
