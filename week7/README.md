Part 2:

Q1: Are the majority of the CpG dinucleotides methylated or unmethylated?
-  majority are unmethylated

Part 3:
Q2:
just nano: 1.2%
just bisulfite: 2.99%
both: 95.85%

Bisulfite sequencing has a larger range of coverage compared to nano, and nano's peak coverage is focused lower than bisulfite sequencing. Overall, it appears bisulfite coverage is better. 

Q3: Bisulfite scores has more concise differences being observed, but ONT was able to get a larger range of differences. 
Q4: It looks like tumor samples are less methylated than normal sample. 

Part 4:
Q5: Theres a large region of the gene that is becoming more methylated specifically in the 25,250,355-25,252,964 region. THe effects would be the silencing of this gene, which is respeonsible for creating new methylation sites, therefore decreasing global methylation of the genome, as less new sites are being made. 

Q6: imprinting means that the gene expression profile (due to epigenetics) has been inherited from the parents. Since we inherit 2 alleles one from each parent you can inherit two different epigenetic signatures. 

Q7: It separates the reads into "none", "1", or "2"
Q8: No, not all regions can be phased because there are not enough features to be sepateated. This could be because there isn't a distinct change from "wildtype".
